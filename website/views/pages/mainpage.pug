      | As the Swedes say it best, hej hej! Thank you for visiting my personal page. 
      | I created this website (see: work-in-progress) mainly for two reasons: 
      li.main Firstly, as a personal diary, to reflect on my learning journey in software development + data analyics 
      li.mainLast Secondly, to share some fun things I am fiddling with at the moment (including building this website!)
